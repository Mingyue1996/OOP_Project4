1. Check the image I put called “directory” in the file to put all the files in correct positions. 
	You might need to create a JavaFX project first in Eclipse. Then you just need to press “Run” button to run the program. 
	This “directory” image has nothing to do with my project. 
	The worst case is to go to my GitHub to make everything work: https://github.com/Mingyue1996/OOP_Project4
	
2. When player vs computer, player starts first. In all the games, player’s user name cannot be Computer 
	(notice:  Computer is case sensitive; in other words, computer can be a user name).
	
3. Click on “Quit the game” to save game results permanently. 
	If you click on the “close” button on the top right of the UI, then game results will not be permanently saved.
	
4. You might not see “it is Computer’s turn” because this label changes very fast and you cannot see it. This is Not an error.

5. On the console (not UI), I printed the row and column number for the trap tile for feature d mentioned above. 
   Once you click on the trap tile, you will lose the game immediately. The professor this feature is OK.

6. For feature 3, you can press “Confirm” button to go back to the game menu. You don’t need to choose a prize to go back to the menu scene. There are three ways to go back:
	(i) Do not select anything (no user names or prizes)
	(ii) Do not select any prizes (you can select user names only)
	(iii) Select a user name and the prize(s) that the user can redeem
	If you select prizes and do not select user names, you cannot go back to the menu. 
	You will see error prompts. You need to deselect prizes and then go back.
	
7. I have three versions for Two D – n*n: 4*4, 5*5, 6*6. The professor said it is OK.

8. I only have sounds for win/loss. No animation. No sound for a tie. The professor said it is OK.

9. In the ultimate tic tac toe, if there is a tie in the inner game board, this inner board would be marked as grey.
